## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository documents my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey**, which I am **currently working on** as part of my **placement and interview preparation**.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build **strong problem-solving skills**
- Master **core DSA concepts**
- Write **efficient and optimized solutions**
- Prepare thoroughly for **technical interviews**

All topics are implemented with a **concept-first approach**, followed by **practical coding problems**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- ✔ Strengthen algorithmic thinking  
- ✔ Improve time and space complexity analysis  
- ✔ Solve real interview-style problems  
- ✔ Develop consistency in competitive programming  
- ✔ Build confidence for coding rounds
